# Comments System

This project simulates a system that allows you to make comments, simple and without many features, it only allows you to create and delete comments.

System development was used:

- For building the GUI (**React** e **styled-component**)
- For data storage (**localstorage**)

This system was based on the video [VueJS em 1 hora! (Teoria e pr√°tica)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSa-SMVMGsE "VueJS em 1 hora! (Teoria e pr√°tica)") from the channel [Ayrton Teshima - Programador a Bordo](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgramadorABordo "ProgramadorABordo"), unlike him, this one was built with Reactjs, the intention is to develop a system (as complex as possible) of comments by parts.

As a beginner, I'm open to contributions for tips, recommendations, and improvements.
